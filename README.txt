Matrix Driver
The driver provides different mathematical operations on matrices:
•	Inverse 
•	Determinant
•	Transpose 
•	Pseudoinverse
•	Addition 
•	Multiplication 
•	Subtraction
Different types of matrices can be represented (Irregular, Line, Column, Square, Diagonal) each with its particularities. 
For more information please see the full documentation of the driver.

Usage
Create an object of the needed type of matrix and populate it by using the populate method in the object. Some types may have different headers for the populate method. After the matrix has been populated, different operation can be made with it.
For the header of each method see the full documentation.

Debugging 
The driver provides printing methods for easy debugging of each matrix and for simple equations.
More details in the full documentation. 

Installation
The driver does not need any external libraries simply include the header of the needed type of matrix.
